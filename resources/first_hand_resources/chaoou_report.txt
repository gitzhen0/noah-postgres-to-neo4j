Abstract
New York City faces increasing pressure on naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), yet
the data needed to understand where affordable units exist, how they are changing over time, and
which communities are most at risk is scattered across multiple open-data portals and file
formats. Urban Labs currently relies on manual processes and ad hoc spreadsheets to assemble
housing, income, and neighborhood indicators, which makes it difficult to answer policy
questions in a timely and consistent way.
This project addresses that problem by designing and implementing a proof-of-concept NOAH
Information Dashboard for Urban Labs. The goal is to create an integrated data foundation and a
working analytics prototype that consolidates key New York City housing and cost-of-living
datasets into a single, reusable tool. The specific aims are to (1) integrate and clean multiple open
datasets, (2) design a relational database and data-access layer, (3) build an interactive web
dashboard with maps and charts, and (4) provide automation scripts and documentation to
support ongoing use.
The proof-of-concept was implemented using Python-based data pipelines, a
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, and a Streamlit web application deployed to the cloud. A
technology trial compared the prototype against the current manual workflow using metrics such
as data preparation time and perceived usability. The results show that the integrated pipeline
and dashboard can substantially reduce manual data wrangling, provide more consistent
geographic coverage at the ZIP code and, where possible, building level, and improve the
visibility of NOAH-related indicators for Urban Labs analysts.
The project concludes that a centralized NOAH information dashboard is a viable and valuable
direction for Urban Labs. It demonstrates how open data can be turned into an operational
decision-support tool for affordable housing analysis. Future work could expand the geographic
and temporal coverage of the datasets, add forecasting and risk-scoring models, and harden the
prototype into a production-quality system supporting broader stakeholders across the housing
ecosystem.

Introduction
New York City’s housing market presents acute affordability challenges for low- and moderateincome households. While subsidized housing programs are heavily studied, a large share of
affordable units exists in the private market as Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing
(NOAH). These units are particularly vulnerable to rent increases, speculative investment, and
redevelopment, yet the data needed to monitor NOAH conditions is fragmented across multiple
NYC Open Data, Census/ACS, PLUTO, and related sources.
Urban Labs, the sponsor of this project, is a research and analytics organization that works with
policymakers and community stakeholders on housing and cost-of-living issues in New York
City. To support their NOAH work, Urban Labs needs a repeatable way to bring together
disparate housing, socioeconomic, and building-level datasets, and to visualize them in an
accessible, geography-based tool.
Problem. Currently, Urban Labs relies on manual download, cleaning, and merging of datasets in
spreadsheets. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce. It also
makes it hard to answer new questions or update analyses when new data is released.
Approach. This applied project develops a proof-of-concept (POC) NOAH Information
Dashboard: an integrated data foundation, a relational database, automated data pipelines, and a
Streamlit web application that provides interactive maps and charts for NOAH-related indicators
at the ZIP/ZCTA and selected building levels.
Core Technology. The solution combines (1) Python for data ingestion, cleaning, and
transformation; (2) PostgreSQL/PostGIS for structured storage and spatial queries; and (3)
Streamlit for quickly building and deploying a lightweight web dashboard suitable for prototype
use with Urban Labs analysts.
Benefits. For the sponsor, the POC aims to (a) reduce manual data-wrangling effort, (b) improve
consistency and documentation of NOAH datasets, and (c) provide a more intuitive interface for
exploring neighborhood conditions and potential NOAH hotspots.
Research Question. The project addresses the question: Can an integrated, automated data
pipeline and web dashboard materially improve Urban Labs’ ability to monitor naturally
occurring affordable housing compared to the current manual, spreadsheet-based workflow?
Sponsor and Importance of Project. The project sponsor is Thomas Jordan at Urban Labs, a nonprofit research organization focused on urban policy and housing. The NOAH Information
Dashboard is important to the sponsor because it directly supports their mission: identifying atrisk NOAH units, understanding neighborhood vulnerability, and informing policy and
advocacy. A working POC gives Urban Labs an actionable starting point they can extend after
the semester ends.

Project Objectives and Metrics
Goal of the Project
The goal of the project was to design and implement a proof-of-concept NOAH Information
Dashboard as a centralized, reusable data and analytics tool for Urban Labs. The dashboard
should consolidate key New York City housing and affordability datasets, support geographic
exploration of NOAH-related indicators, and provide a technical foundation that Urban Labs can
extend in future phases.
Project Deliverables and Metrics
Project Objective 1 – Integrated data foundation
Metric: Successfully retrieve, clean, and standardize data from multiple NYC open-data sources
(e.g., PLUTO, ACS-derived indicators, and other NOAH-relevant datasets) into a consistent
schema that can be reused in the dashboard and database.
Project Objective 2 – Working database and data-access layer
Metric: Design and populate a relational database that stores cleaned NOAH-related indicators
by geography (ZIP/ZCTA and, where available, building) and supports basic query and filtering
needs for analysis and visualization.
Project Objective 3 – Streamlit dashboard with maps and charts
Metric: Develop a functional Streamlit-based web dashboard prototype that provides at least one
interactive map and several charts allowing users to explore NOAH-related indicators (e.g.,
rents, income, housing units, and related metrics) by geography.
Project Objective 4 – Automation, documentation, and final proof of concept
Metric: Implement Python scripts to automate data retrieval and updates for selected sources, and
deliver a complete POC package including the deployed Streamlit app, database schema, data
pipeline scripts, and user/technical documentation sufficient for Urban Labs to understand and
extend the system.
Project Evaluation
Project success was evaluated by comparing the original objectives and metrics to the final
deliverables documented in the Sponsor’s Project Acceptance – RESULTS form, by assessing
whether the dashboard and data pipeline were functional on realistic NOAH use cases, and by
collecting sponsor feedback on usability and usefulness during demonstrations. The technology
trial also provided empirical evidence on time savings and workflow improvements relative to
the manual baseline.

Alternate Solutions Evaluated
Before selecting the final solution stack, several alternative approaches were considered for both
the data and visualization layers.
Manual spreadsheet-based approach (status quo). One option was to continue relying on
Excel/Google Sheets as the primary integration and analysis environment. While familiar and
low-cost, this approach does not scale well to multiple large datasets, leads to inconsistent
versions of data, and makes geographic analyses cumbersome. This option was therefore used
only as the baseline for comparison.
Business intelligence tools (Tableau/Power BI). A second option was to build the NOAH
dashboard directly in tools like Tableau or Power BI, connecting to CSV files or simple
databases. These tools provide rich visualization capabilities and interactive dashboards;
however, they are less flexible for building automated data pipelines, integrating multiple APIs,
and implementing custom geospatial logic. Licensing and deployment for external non-technical
users also posed constraints.
Cloud-native data warehouse and BI stack. A more scalable option would have been to use a
cloud data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake or BigQuery) combined with a BI front end. While
powerful, this approach would add cost and operational complexity beyond the scope of a
semester-long POC and would require additional integration work for Urban Labs to maintain.
Custom Python + PostgreSQL + Streamlit solution (selected). The chosen solution uses
Python for ETL, PostgreSQL/PostGIS for data storage and geospatial support, and Streamlit for
the dashboard front end. This stack offers high flexibility, strong support for open-data and
geospatial workflows, and low licensing costs. It also fits well with academic and open-source
practices, making it easier for Urban Labs to continue development after the course.
Solution Evaluation Criteria
The alternatives were evaluated using criteria including: (1) ability to integrate multiple opendata sources, (2) support for geographic and building-level analysis, (3) ease of automation and
reproducibility, (4) cost and licensing constraints, (5) ease of deployment and sharing with the
sponsor, and (6) alignment with the scope and timeframe of a semester project.
Selection Rationale
The custom Python + PostgreSQL + Streamlit solution was selected because it best balanced
flexibility, geospatial capabilities, automation, and practicality. It allowed the student to
implement end-to-end pipelines, control data models, and rapidly prototype an interactive

9

dashboard without heavy infrastructure overhead. Tableau/Power BI were retained as potential
complementary tools for future visualization, but not as the core integration platform.

Literature Survey
Introduction
This literature review summarizes existing research and practice related to naturally occurring
affordable housing (NOAH), housing affordability analytics, and the use of integrated data
systems and dashboards for urban policy. It synthesizes work on the broader housing and costof-living context in New York City, the specific challenges of identifying and preserving NOAH
units, and the role of data infrastructure and visualization in supporting decision-making by
practitioners like Urban Labs.
The Industry
Urban data infrastructures have matured from static repositories into dynamic, participatory
systems. Barns (2018) characterizes urban data platforms as “interfaces for smart governance,”
mediating between technical innovation and civic accountability. Kitchin, Lauriault, and
McArdle (2015) extend this notion, arguing that dashboards translate raw data into actionable
knowledge by embedding performance indicators directly into governance cycles. Similarly,
Pluto-Kossakowska (2022) finds that municipal dashboards can democratize sustainability
initiatives by visualizing complex data in forms that residents understand, creating shared
ownership of results.
Within the housing sector, scholars highlight the economic and social significance of reliable
affordability metrics. Waddell (2023) positions data-driven housing analysis as essential to
regional planning, while Biljanovska (2023) documents the International Monetary Fund’s effort
to standardize affordability indicators globally. Both show that data integration improves policy
consistency across scales. Bibri and Krogstie (2020) further connect these analytics to
sustainability, demonstrating that London and Barcelona use integrated dashboards to align
housing, energy, and mobility data with climate objectives.
Industry research therefore reveals two converging trajectories: technological consolidation
through shared data standards, and institutional transformation toward evidence-based decision
systems. For nonprofits like Urban Labs, these developments legitimize investment in
lightweight, open dashboards that translate public data into strategic insights for community
partners.
The Problem
Despite the growing availability of public datasets, scholars consistently describe fragmentation,
inconsistency, and inaccessibility as enduring barriers. Silvestri (2024) observes that data
generated by separate municipal departments remain locked in incompatible schemas and
formats. Bentley et al. (2012) demonstrate that such gaps have real consequences: weak
affordability metrics prevent early detection of social stress and mental-health effects caused by
rent burden. Without integrated data pipelines, agencies lack longitudinal visibility across
neighborhoods.

11

Kitchin (2016) warns that even when dashboards exist, poor data governance may produce
illusory real-time awareness, a condition where decision makers believe they possess accurate
information while relying on incomplete or unverified inputs. Barns (2018) echoes this concern,
noting that the absence of standardized metadata undermines public trust. In the context of New
York City, disparate data sources such as the American Community Survey (ACS), PLUTO
land-use records, and local rent datasets are updated on different cycles and hosted on separate
portals. Urban Labs currently must manually merge and validate these files, which is a process
that can take weeks and is prone to error.
At a conceptual level, the problem is twofold: (1) technical fragmentation in data structures and
APIs, and (2) organizational fragmentation across research, policy, and community actors.
Together they prevent timely, holistic assessment of affordability trends.
The Proposed Solution
Scholars propose integrative frameworks that combine open data standards with participatory
design. Sauvé-Schenk et al. (2025) present the DASH System for affordable housing, illustrating
how transparency and visualization encourage inter-agency collaboration. Their research
confirms that open-source dashboards can perform as both technical and social infrastructures.
Nidam (2025) adds that co-creation with end users enhances inclusivity and adoption—important
for nonprofits that rely on diverse stakeholders rather than top-down mandates.
Bibri and Krogstie (2020) and Wolf (2025) converge on the view that successful data systems
balance analytical sophistication with institutional capacity. Over-engineered proprietary
platforms often fail in civic contexts due to cost and maintenance demands. Streamlit and similar
Python-based frameworks, by contrast, enable rapid prototyping, open access, and long-term
sustainability, precisely the rationale behind the NOAH Dashboard.
In practical terms, the literature supports an open-data ecosystem grounded in reproducibility,
transparency, and collaborative governance. For Urban Labs, this translates into an architecture
that automates data retrieval from the Census API and NYC Open Data, validates each record,
and visualizes metrics such as median rent, median income, vacancy rate, and rent burden
through an interactive web interface.
The Technology
Technological research outlines the foundations of data-driven urban platforms. Silvestri (2024)
proposes a modular “urban intelligence architecture” that decouples data ingestion,
transformation, and visualization. Lloret et al. (2025) expand this with an AI-ready, dashboardcentric framework combining sensors, APIs, and visualization layers for digital transformation in
smart cities. These architectures emphasize interoperability through RESTful APIs,
containerization, and metadata alignment—all feasible with the NOAH Dashboard’s Python and
PostgreSQL stack.
Yap and Biljecki (2023) contribute empirical evidence that standardized urban indicators enable
cross-city benchmarking. Their Scientific Data dataset demonstrates that consistent schemas can
scale from local to global analyses, a design philosophy mirrored in NOAH’s ZIP-code model.
Kitchin (2016) and Barns (2018) emphasize that dashboards are not just technological tools but
12

socio-technical systems requiring clear data-governance protocols. Therefore, the NOAH project
incorporates validation scripts, data dictionaries, and documentation following these
recommendations.
Furthermore, modern dashboards rely on cloud deployment for scalability. Wolf (2025)
documents how sustainable platforms evolve from prototypes to production systems through
containerized hosting and version control. Streamlit Cloud fulfills similar roles at smaller scale:
automated dependency management, continuous deployment from GitHub, and browser-based
sharing. Together these technologies address both the integration and dissemination needs
identified earlier.
Importantly, the reviewed literature also reveals the ethical dimension of data architecture.
Kitchin (2016) and Bibri & Krogstie (2020) warn that algorithmic bias and unequal access can
undermine data-driven governance. Hence, open-source transparency and clear methodological
notes are as vital as technical performance, which are principles the NOAH Dashboard explicitly
embeds through its documentation and open repository.
Use Cases
Case studies from multiple regions demonstrate tangible benefits of civic dashboards. Wolf
(2025) examines the UK Urban Observatories and the Smart Columbus Operating System,
concluding that long-term success depends on organizational learning, not merely technical
deployment. Bibri and Krogstie (2020) describe how Barcelona’s and London’s dashboards
improved resource allocation for sustainability projects, reducing duplication among agencies.
Sauvé-Schenk’s DASH initiative offers the most direct housing parallel. Within one year of
implementation, partner agencies reported faster social-housing placement decisions and
improved public transparency. The authors attribute this to combining spatial data with
interactive visualization—an approach identical to NOAH’s ZIP-level rent-burden maps.
Other scholars explore user adoption. Nidam (2025) finds that participatory co-design workshops
increase user confidence and long-term engagement. Pluto-Kossakowska (2022) similarly reports
that community feedback loops maintain dashboard relevance over time. These findings justify
NOAH’s iterative design cycle and feedback survey integrated into the technology-trial phase.
The reviewed examples also expose pitfalls: some dashboards stagnate when funding lapses or
when data updates require specialized staff. Wolf (2025) emphasizes establishing internal
training and governance committees, a lesson already applied in Urban Labs’ plan to produce
detailed documentation and tutorial videos.
Collectively, these cases demonstrate that dashboards achieve impact when technical reliability
aligns with organizational capacity and user literacy. For Urban Labs, adopting these principles
ensures that the NOAH Dashboard remains both scientifically credible and socially embedded.
Conclusion
The reviewed scholarship provides both theoretical justification and practical guidance
for the NOAH Information Dashboard.

13

Industry research confirms a growing reliance on dashboards as instruments of
transparency and performance measurement. Problem-focused studies reveal persistent
fragmentation in housing data that impedes evidence-based policymaking. Technical literature
outlines architectures, modular, API-driven, open source, that directly inform NOAH’s system
design. Case studies validate the social value of these systems when accompanied by
participatory design and institutional support.
In synthesizing these strands, this review demonstrates that the NOAH Dashboard
extends existing smart-city research into the nonprofit domain. It serves as a model for how
lightweight, transparent technologies can democratize access to urban knowledge. Future
research should evaluate longitudinal adoption metrics—frequency of use, decision impact, and
maintenance cost, to further integrate data science with urban-policy innovation.

Approach and Methodology
Problem Statement and Research Question
The project addresses the problem of fragmented NOAH-relevant data and manual,
unsustainable workflows at Urban Labs. The central research question is whether an integrated,
automated pipeline and web dashboard can materially improve their ability to monitor NOAH
compared to the existing spreadsheet-based processes.
Proof of Concept Approach
The proof of concept was structured around the functional requirements specification (FRS) and
agreed objectives. Key components included:
•

Identifying and prioritizing NOAH-relevant datasets at the ZCTA and building levels.

•

Designing a relational schema suitable for linking these datasets by geography.

•

Building Python-based ETL scripts to ingest, clean, and transform data into the database.

•

Implementing a Streamlit web application to expose the data via maps, charts, and filters.

•

Running a technology trial to compare the new workflow with the baseline and capture
sponsor feedback.

Technology Trial Plan
The Technology Trial Plan defined hypotheses (e.g., reducing data preparation time, improving
usability and satisfaction), metrics, and a structured three-phase trial: setup, execution, and
observation. A small set of realistic analysis tasks was used to compare the manual baseline
against the dashboard-based workflow, focusing on time to insight, number of manual steps, and
perceived ease of use.
Population/Data
The project used publicly available datasets from NYC Open Data, PLUTO, and other NOAHrelated sources, complemented by demographic and socioeconomic indicators derived from the
American Community Survey (ACS). The primary “population” was ZIP codes/ZCTAs within
New York City, with building-level records added where PLUTO and related datasets allowed.
The independent variables include housing characteristics and neighborhood indicators; the
dependent outcomes are NOAH-relevant measures such as affordability categories and risk
signals.
Procedures
1. Requirements and design. Refine requirements with the sponsor, document them in the FRS,
and design the database schema and data model.

15

2. Data acquisition and cleaning. Implement Python scripts to download, clean, and geocode
datasets as needed; resolve key and schema inconsistencies.
3. Database implementation. Create tables, load cleaned data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and
validate referential integrity.
4. Dashboard development. Build a Streamlit app with map and chart views, filtering controls,
and informative labels and tooltips.
5. Technology trial. Define baseline tasks, time the manual vs. dashboard-based workflows, and
collect sponsor observations.
6. Documentation and reporting. Prepare user instructions, technical notes, and this final report.
Measurements and Data Collection
During the technology trial, metrics such as time spent preparing data, number of manual
transformations, and qualitative ease-of-use ratings were collected. Additional “implicit” metrics
include the number of NOAH-relevant indicators readily accessible in the dashboard and the
geographic coverage achieved. Data were collected by timing task completion, observing the
sponsor’s interactions, and reviewing log outputs from the ETL scripts.
Data Analysis
Quantitative trial results were summarized with descriptive statistics (e.g., average time savings,
number of steps eliminated), while qualitative observations were analyzed for recurring themes
such as clarity of visuals and navigation. These findings were then compared to the original
objectives to assess whether the POC met expectations.
Organizational Change Plan (Summary)
From an organizational perspective, the main barriers to adoption include staff familiarity with
the manual workflow, concerns about data correctness in an automated system, and limited
technical resources. The organizational change management plan proposes stakeholder mapping,
communication and training sessions, and a phased rollout in which the dashboard initially
complements, rather than replaces, existing processes. Over time, as confidence grows, more
analyses can migrate to the new pipeline.

16

Results
Data Processing
The project successfully ingested and cleaned multiple NOAH-relevant datasets into a unified
database. Key processing steps included harmonizing geographic identifiers (e.g., ZIP vs.
ZCTA), standardizing field names and data types, and handling missing or inconsistent values.
The final schema supports joining housing, demographic, and building attributes at the
ZIP/ZCTA and selected building levels.
Findings
The NOAH Information Dashboard enables Urban Labs to visualize spatial patterns in housing
affordability. For example, the map view highlights clusters of ZIP codes with high rent burdens
relative to income, while other charts reveal relationships between housing stock characteristics
and affordability indicators. The building-level integration for selected areas demonstrates how
PLUTO data can be used to zoom from neighborhoods down to individual parcels.

Summary Statistics
Across the datasets loaded into the prototype, the database includes 177 NYC ZIP/ZCTAs and
about 100,000 residential buildings with associated NOAH-relevant attributes. Summary
statistics for key indicators—such as median rent, median income, and vacancy-related fields,
provide a baseline for comparing neighborhoods.

citywide metrics.
Quantitative Results (Technology Trial)
In the technology trial, the automated pipeline and dashboard reduced the time required to
assemble NOAH-relevant datasets for a sample analysis task by about 50% compared to the
manual workflow. The number of manual steps decreased, and the sponsor reported that the map
and chart views made it easier to spot emerging patterns, such as areas with rising rents and
stagnant incomes.
18

Qualitative Observations
Qualitative feedback from the sponsor emphasized three strengths of the POC:
(1) Having a “single place” to explore NOAH data;
(2) The ability to filter and compare neighborhoods interactively;
(3) Improved confidence that data transformations were documented and repeatable. Suggestions
for improvement included expanding the set of indicators and refining some visualization
choices for clarity.
Outcomes and Implications
The results indicate that even a relatively lightweight, open-source stack can deliver meaningful
improvements in how Urban Labs accesses and analyzes NOAH data. The POC demonstrates the
feasibility of a centralized NOAH information system and suggests that further investment in
automation and modeling could yield significant efficiency and insight gains.

Issues Encountered
Several issues were encountered during the project, many of which were anticipated in the risk
management plan.
Data quality and consistency. Some open datasets contained missing, outdated, or inconsistent
values, especially for building-level attributes. This was mitigated through cleaning rules,
conservative filtering, and clear documentation of limitations.
Geographic alignment. Aligning different geographic units (ZIP, ZCTA, census tract, and
PLUTO parcels) created complexity in the data model. The use of ZCTAs as a common
denominator, supplemented by PostGIS spatial joins, helped manage this issue, but perfect
alignment was not always possible.
Performance and hosting constraints. Running a geospatial dashboard on limited resources
required careful optimization of queries and caching of pre-aggregated tables. Streamlit Cloud
imposed constraints on memory and CPU, which influenced the size and complexity of the initial
deployment.
Time and scope management. As the project progressed, opportunities arose to extend the
scope (e.g., deeper building-level analysis). The status reports and sponsor discussions were used
to prioritize core objectives and defer some enhancements to future work, keeping the project
manageable within the semester.
Most of these issues were either explicitly captured in the risk management plan or closely
related to identified risks. Mitigation strategies—such as incremental development, frequent
testing, and early sponsor feedback—helped ensure that none of the issues prevented delivery of
a functioning proof of concept.

21

Lessons Learned
From a technical perspective, the project provided hands-on experience with designing an endto-end data product: integrating multiple open datasets, modeling data for geospatial analysis,
implementing ETL pipelines in Python, and deploying a working web dashboard for a real
sponsor. It reinforced the importance of investing time up front in data modeling and cleaning to
avoid downstream problems in the visualization and analysis layers.
From a project management perspective, the work highlighted the value of clear objectives,
regular status reporting, and realistic scoping when working with an external sponsor. Status
reports, risk planning, and the technology trial plan proved especially useful in aligning
expectations and managing changes. The experience also underscored how important it is to
communicate technical trade-offs in non-technical language so that sponsors can make informed
decisions.
Overall, the applied project demonstrated how a relatively small technical team can deliver a
meaningful proof of concept that addresses a real-world policy problem, provided that
requirements are well understood, risks are managed proactively, and the solution leverages
appropriate open-source tools.

22

Conclusion and Further Work
Conclusions
This project set out to determine whether an integrated data pipeline and dashboard could
improve Urban Labs’ ability to monitor naturally occurring affordable housing in New York
City. The proof-of-concept NOAH Information Dashboard successfully met its core objectives:
integrating multiple NOAH-relevant datasets, designing a relational and spatially aware
database, building an interactive Streamlit dashboard, and providing automation scripts and
documentation.
The POC demonstrates that Urban Labs can move beyond manual, spreadsheet-based workflows
toward a more systematic, reproducible, and scalable approach to NOAH analytics. It provides a
concrete artifact that can be used to support internal discussions, stakeholder engagement, and
future funding proposals.
Implications
For practice, the project shows how open data and open-source tools can be combined to support
affordable housing research within resource-constrained organizations. For the broader field, it
illustrates a replicable pattern—integrated data foundation + geospatial dashboard—that other
cities and organizations could adapt to their own NOAH or housing affordability challenges.
Limitations
The prototype is limited in scope and robustness. It covers a subset of potential NOAH-relevant
datasets and focuses primarily on descriptive analytics rather than predictive modeling.
Performance and security have been addressed at a basic level suitable for a POC, but further
hardening would be needed for production use. Data quality issues and geographic alignment
constraints also limit the precision of some indicators.
Further Work
Future work could include:
•

Expanding the set of indicators (e.g., eviction filings, tax lien data, or code violations).

•

Incorporating time-series views to track changes in NOAH indicators over multiple years.

•

Adding risk-scoring models to identify buildings or neighborhoods at high risk of NOAH
loss.

•

Improving the user interface and adding role-specific views for different stakeholders.

•

Migrating the prototype to a more scalable production environment if adopted by Urban
Labs.

Closing Summary
23

In summary, the NOAH Information Dashboard proof of concept demonstrates that it is both
feasible and valuable to create a centralized NOAH information system for Urban Labs using
open data and open-source tools. While further work is needed to scale and refine the solution,
the project has delivered a concrete foundation that advances the sponsor’s mission and
contributes a practical example of applied data engineering and analytics in the affordable
housing domain.

Use Case

Persona: Alex, an analyst at Urban Labs, tasked with researching housing affordability across New York
City.

Scenario:

35

Alex accesses the NOAH Information Dashboard to compare rental affordability between ZIP codes in
Brooklyn and the Bronx. Upon loading the dashboard, he uses the interactive map to filter by ZIP and views
a choropleth map showing median rent and income levels. He notices that ZIP 11212 has a high rent burden
and low median income. Alex downloads the data for further analysis in Excel and includes it in his Urban
Labs briefing report on housing inequality.

Later, the automated update script (update_data.py) runs overnight, refreshing all datasets from the Census
API and NYC Open Data. The next day, Alex logs in again to find new 2024 ACS data automatically
reflected in the dashboard—without manual intervention. He presents the latest figures to the policy team,
confident that the data is accurate, up-to-date, and centrally managed through the NOAH Dashboard POC.

RE:

The Organizational Change Plan

The Organizational Change Plan
1. Objective Clarification
Vision: The NOAH Information Dashboard aims to transform Urban Labs’ fragmented datacollection workflow into a unified, automated platform that integrates housing, income, and
affordability datasets from public APIs. This technological change aligns with the organization’s
strategic goal of becoming a data-driven research leader capable of producing timely, evidencebased insights for New York City housing policy.
Key Outcomes: Success will be demonstrated through a ≥ 60 % reduction in manual dataprocessing time, a ≥ 40 % improvement in user satisfaction with data accessibility, and full
operational deployment of the dashboard by December 2025, enabling researchers to access
standardized, up-to-date data within seconds.
2. Stakeholder Engagement
Identify Stakeholders: Primary stakeholders include Urban Labs’ data analysts, research
coordinators, project managers, and leadership team, as well as NYU Capstone faculty sponsors.
Secondary stakeholders are city policy partners and technical collaborators involved in data
sourcing.
Communication Plan: Project updates and change notices will be delivered via bi-weekly team
meetings, Slack announcements, and email briefings. A dedicated Confluence page will track
43

milestones, while quarterly sponsor reviews will align all parties on adoption progress and
feedback.
3. Cultural Assessment and Planning Section
Current Culture Analysis: Urban Labs maintains a collaborative but data-siloed culture—
teams are research-focused, yet each manages its own datasets with limited cross-sharing.
Strengths include analytical rigor and mission alignment; weaknesses include inconsistent digital
workflows and limited automation familiarity.
Desired Culture Definition: The NOAH initiative seeks to foster a culture of innovation,
openness, and data collaboration—encouraging staff to rely on centralized, transparent digital
systems and continuous improvement through shared dashboards and reproducible analytics.
4. Change Management Section
Change Model Adoption: Kotter’s 8-Step Model will guide the transition: building urgency
around data inefficiency, forming a cross-functional coalition, communicating the vision,
removing technical barriers, generating short-term wins via pilot tests, and embedding data
automation into daily routines.
Resistance Management: Potential resistance may arise from staff apprehension about technical
complexity or loss of data control. Early hands-on demos, peer mentoring, and open Q&A
sessions will address concerns proactively and reinforce the personal and institutional benefits of
adoption.
Skills and Capability Enhancement Section
Skills Inventory: Current skills include strong policy analysis and data interpretation but limited
experience with Python, APIs, and spatial databases. Identified gaps involve coding literacy,
dashboard operation, and API troubleshooting.
Training and Development: A two-phase training plan will upskill existing researchers through
short Python for Data Automation workshops and Streamlit dashboard tutorials. If required, a
part-time data engineer will be onboarded to ensure sustainability and mentor internal staff.
5. Documentation and Communication Section

44

Process Documentation: All project phases—from planning to technology trial—will be
recorded in GitHub Wiki and Confluence, capturing decisions, scripts, data models, and
encountered challenges. Version control commits will ensure reproducibility and transparency.
Feedback Mechanisms: User feedback will be collected through bi-weekly surveys and
monthly retrospectives. Findings will feed into sprint reviews, allowing real-time adjustments to
dashboard usability and automation features.
6. Integration and Adaptation Section
Scalability Plan: Upon successful trial completion, the NOAH Dashboard will migrate from
local hosting to Streamlit Cloud or AWS EC2 for multi-user access. Standard operating
procedures will embed dashboard use into Urban Labs’ research workflow templates.
Continuous Improvement: A standing “Data Innovation Committee” will monitor metrics
quarterly, implement incremental enhancements, and evaluate new datasets or AI modules for
future integration—ensuring ongoing alignment with Urban Labs’ research goals.

RE: Technology Trial Plan NOAH Project
Business Task and Objectives
The NOAH Information Dashboard project seeks to improve how Urban Labs collects,
consolidates, and visualizes public housing and socioeconomic data from multiple open data
APIs. Currently, researchers must manually download and merge CSV files from sources such as
the
U.S. Census Bureau (ACS), NYC Open Data, and HUD User datasets, which is a process that is
time consuming and inconsistent.
Objective: Test a proof-of-concept (POC) automated data pipeline and interactive web
dashboard that can:
• Pull and clean housing and income data from multiple sources in real time,
• Store them in a single standardized repository (PostgreSQL + PostGIS), and
• Visualize ZIP- and building-level metrics within a Streamlit front-end.
Success will be defined by measurable improvements in data-processing time, system reliability,
and visualization usability compared with the current manual workflow.

The Hypothesis
Population: Urban Labs researchers and policy analysts who regularly use NYC housing
datasets. Intervention: Implementation of an automated Python-based pipeline and Streamlit
dashboard that consolidate data by ZIP and building.
Expected Outcome: Reduce data-preparation time by at least 60% and improve dataset
consistency and user satisfaction with data access by 40%.

46

Control: The current manual process of downloading, merging, and analyzing separate CSV
files using Excel or individual Python scripts.

47

Hypothesis Statement: “By introducing the NOAH Dashboard, we hypothesize that Urban Labs
researchers will reduce data collection and processing time by 60% and increase satisfaction with data
access by 40% compared to the current manual process, while maintaining equal or higher data
accuracy.”

Baseline Metrics and Control Group
Baseline Metrics:
• Average time to collect and merge three datasets manually.
• Number of data errors or missing records per run (current ≈ 5%).
• User satisfaction with data access.
Control Group Setup:
• Maintain the manual workflow for two analysts during the trial.
• Compare their performance with two analysts using the NOAH Dashboard (intervention
group).

The Trial
• Duration: Three weeks (November 1 – November 21, 2025).
• Metrics: Data processing time, data accuracy, and user satisfaction survey results.
• Comparison Plan: Measure percentage improvement for each metric between the manual
(control) and automated (intervention) methods.
Trial Phases:
Setup: Deploy PostgreSQL database and Streamlit dashboard on local server. Execution: Run data
update scripts (fetch_zcta_data.py, fetch_pluto_residential.py, update_data.py) daily for both methods.
Observation: Track timing logs, error rates, and feedback forms.
The Technology
• Data Integration Layer: Python (Pandas, Requests, GeoPandas) with Socrata and Census
APIs.
• Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for spatial data storage and joins.
• Visualization Interface: Streamlit + PyDeck for interactive ZIP choropleths and buildinglevel point maps.
• Automation: GitHub Actions for daily data refresh and quality checks.

Data Collection
• System Logs: Capture processing start/end times and error counts per update cycle.

48

•
•

Database Metrics: Row counts, null values, and join success rates before and after
integration.
User Survey: Short Likert-scale survey (1–5) on data access ease and dashboard usability.

49

•

Data File Format:
o Columns: run_id, method, runtime_sec, errors, satisfaction_score.
o Stored as trial_metrics.csv for analysis.

Analysis of Results
• Compute mean and standard deviation for processing times (control vs intervention).
• Run paired t-tests to test significance of time reduction (p < 0.05).
• Compare error rates and survey scores using percentage improvement.
• Visualize results with bar charts and boxplots in Python (Seaborn / Matplotlib).
• Assess whether improvements exceed the expected threshold (60% time reduction,
40% satisfaction increase).
Findings and Recommendations
Findings (expected): Substantial runtime reduction (≥60%), fewer errors (≥50%), higher
satisfaction (≥40%).
Recommendations:
•
•
•

Adopt Python + PostGIS + Streamlit for ongoing research.
Cap building points per ZIP (slider) and add server-side filters (landuse=01/02/03).
Plan cloud deployment (Streamlit Cloud/AWS) and role-based access if moving
beyond POC.

- Ranking: A (Highly cited; peer-reviewed journal linking housing
affordability to public health outcomes.)
- Abstract: This population-based longitudinal study investigates how repeated
exposure to poor housing affordability affects mental health. Using data from
the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (2001–
2007), the authors find that prolonged spending of > 30 % of income on
housing is associated with higher psychological distress, particularly among
low-income women.
- Summary: Bentley et al. (2011) demonstrate that sustained affordability
stress produces cumulative mental-health effects beyond short-term financial
hardship. They argue for housing-policy interventions that monitor long-term
rent burden as a social-determinant indicator.
- Researcher comments: This study supports NOAH’s decision to include
“rent burden over time” as a critical metric in the dashboard. It illustrates how
data on affordability and well-being can inform evidence-based housing
policy for Urban Labs research.

systems. The paper analyzes technical and ethical challenges related to data
quality, standardization, and interpretability within smart-city infrastructures.
Summary: Kitchin (2016) argues that city dashboards have become core tools
for governing urban systems by aggregating fragmented indicators into
interpretable interfaces. However, he warns that “real-time cities” may create
false transparency if data are poorly governed or unverified. This paper sets
the conceptual foundation for critical and ethical dashboard development.
Researcher comments: Kitchin’s analysis strengthens the NOAH project’s
rationale for establishing clear data-validation and documentation standards. It
supports the inclusion of data quality and transparency criteria in the
Functional Requirement Specification and Technology Trial evaluation.

- Ranking: A (peer-reviewed, open-access, written by one of the main authors
in urban dashboards; widely cited — very safe to use.)
- Abstract: This article examines how cities are increasingly being measured
and governed through urban indicators, benchmarking systems, and real-time
dashboards. The authors argue that these tools form part of a wider
assemblage of data infrastructures that make cities more “legible” to
governments, but they also shape what is made visible and what is ignored.
The paper discusses technical, political, and epistemological issues in building
and using dashboards.
- Summary: Kitchin, Lauriault, and McArdle (2015) show that dashboards are
not just visual toys — they are governing devices. By standardizing indicators
and updating them frequently, cities can compare performance across space
and time, support policy interventions, and communicate with the public. At
the same time, the authors warn that dashboards depend on data quality, clear
metadata, and careful indicator selection.
- Researcher comments: This paper justifies why an NYC housing dashboard
is a legitimate way to “know and govern” affordability issues, and it reminds
us to document indicators (rent burden, vacancy, median income) clearly.
